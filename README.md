## My process

The first step I took was to add a CSS reset, to which I added the custom variables for the colours and the font.
I then built out the html frame for what I would need before adding the styling the elements, adding active states where needed.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This challenge enbaled me to work on using psuedo elements.
